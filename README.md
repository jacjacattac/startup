# Startup
## J Floral Co Website 
Wedding planning can be very difficult, and it’s especially hard in the beginning stages of planning to get a ballpark of costs. J Floral Co. is a floral company that handles all sorts of flower arrangements, but specializes in wedding florals. This website will showcase the florist’s work, as well as provide a page where people can receive an estimated cost based on the number of guests, bridesmaids, and groomsmen at the wedding. This will provide customers an opportunity to figure out their budget sooner rather than later. The impressive work of J Floral Co. that is readily available for them to see will influence them to hire her for their special day. 

## Mock Website Design 
This is a generic layout. The text and features on the website is accurate, though the photos are not.
